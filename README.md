I always say I like C++, but then I remember why I prefer my programming languages like girls, 
with as many CLEAR warning messages (*sTl pRoToTyPe TemPlaTe intensifies*) 
and as few problems that I have to deal with as possible.

Might learn Rust, might learn how to be an actual good programmer, who knows?
(Rust is good, I actually just suck)

For real though, I like low level stuff, mostly because my family is low-class.
Well, it's more because I always had to gather my toys after I was done playing with time, 
but that's a second part...

Got interested about web development because of the same reasons why an artist becomes interested in nsfw.
Well, it's more because I want to learn how to build a platform for myself
and be able to add at known programming languages "HTML" and "CSS" because my humor is just as dry
as my eyes (I already shed every tear that I had when learning Java).
