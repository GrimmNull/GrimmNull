As a React monkey, my religion demands me to start this public announcement with "Angular bad",
thanks for coming to my TED Talks. Also, Vue good! Thanks again!

But seriously, which one of you lied to me all these years that 'jAvAsCriPt bAd'?
After a few months working with it I can proudly say that now I can shoot myself in the foot profesionally,
and at least, at the end of the day, I'll have a good laugh before the tears and suffering kick in.

Javascript is love, null is life and some low-level programming didn't kill the cat, so I enjoy doing some
C++ now and then until I declare strings using single quotes, moment when I know, I'm too much of a zoomer for this
11/10 would get error messages longer than the Bible and twice as confusing again...

Judging by how I made decisions in life until now, I should already be wearing white face paint and a rainbow wig,
so might as well be a clown with personality.

#head {
  & > #face {
      background: white;
      & > #nose {
        background: red;
      }
  }
  & > #head-hair {
      background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)
  }
}

Yes, I used ids in css, sue me! (actually please don't, I only get 20RONs monthly, I don't have money for Saul Goodman)
