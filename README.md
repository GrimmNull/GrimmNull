I always say that I like C++, but when I use it I remember why I like my programming languages how I like my girls, 
with as many CLEAR warning messages (*sTl pRoToTyPe TemPlaTe intensifies*) 
and as few problems to deal with as possible.

Might learn Rust, might learn how to be an actual good programmer, who knows?
(Rust is good, I actually just suck)

For real though, I like low-level stuff because the universe put me in a low-class family.
Well, it's more because I always had to gather my toys after I was done playing with them or I'd lose them, 
but that's the second part...

Got interested in web development from the same reasons why an artist becomes interested in nsfw.
Well, ackthually I want to learn how to build a platform for myself
and be able to add to known programming languages "HTML" and "CSS" because my humor is just as dry
as my eyes (I already shed every tear that I had when learning Java).

Judging by how I took decisions in life until now, I should already be wearing white paint and a rainbow wig,
so might as well be a clown with personality.
